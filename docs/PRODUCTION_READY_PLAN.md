# AgentFlow Pitch Hub - Production-Ready Front-End Plan

## Objective

**Transform the AgentFlow Pitch Hub wireframe into a production-ready React front-end that Stephen can connect to his Microsoft 365 middleware.**

When this plan is complete:
- Every button and interaction will be wired up and functional
- All data will flow through a service layer that can swap mock data for real API calls
- TypeScript interfaces will define the contract between front-end and middleware
- A comprehensive API specification will document exactly what endpoints Stephen needs to build
- The GUI will be ready for production use once middleware is connected

**Governance:** All implementation work will follow GOLDEN_RULES.md (Question → Plan → Approval → Code workflow, SRP, DRY, security by default, max 300 lines per file, max 40 lines per function).

## Architecture Principles (from Senior Review)

### Authentication Model
- **Front-end obtains tokens for the backend API scope only** (e.g., `api://agentflow-backend/access_as_user`) using MSAL Browser
- **Front-end NEVER requests Graph scopes directly** — no Graph tokens held by client
- **Middleware performs On-Behalf-Of (OBO)** to call Microsoft Graph using the backend token
- This keeps middleware stateless and Graph permissions under control

### Data Flow
```
User → MSAL (get backend token) → Front-end → Backend API → OBO → Microsoft Graph
```

### Role & Access Control
- Explicit route guards for staff vs client views
- Domain-restricted sharing (clients can only share within their email domain)
- Permission levels: Full Access, Proposal Only, Documents Only, specific items

### API Conventions

**Versioning**: All endpoints use `/api/v1/` prefix.

**Hub-Scoped Endpoints**: All data operations include hubId in the path:
- Staff: `/api/v1/hubs/{hubId}/...`
- Client Portal: `/api/v1/hubs/{hubId}/portal/...`

**Pagination**: All list endpoints support `?page`, `?pageSize`, `?sort`, `?filter`, `?search`.

**Common Error Responses**:

| Status | Code | When |
|--------|------|------|
| 401 | `UNAUTHENTICATED` | No valid token |
| 403 | `FORBIDDEN` | User lacks permission |
| 404 | `NOT_FOUND` | Resource doesn't exist |
| 409 | `CONFLICT` | Duplicate resource |
| 413 | `PAYLOAD_TOO_LARGE` | File exceeds limit |
| 429 | `RATE_LIMITED` | Too many requests |
| 5xx | `INTERNAL_ERROR` | Server error |

**Event Tracking**: Uses enum types (not free-text strings) for reliable analytics.

## Phase 1: Audit & Document

**Goal:** Create a complete inventory of the current state — what works, what's placeholder, what's broken, and what each section needs from the middleware.

### Deliverable
`docs/FRONTEND_AUDIT.md` — A comprehensive audit document

### Tasks

#### 1.1 Audit Authentication & Routing
- Document current auth flow (localStorage-based demo)
- Define MSAL integration plan (backend API token only, no Graph tokens)
- Audit role-gating paths and redirect rules
- Document route guards needed for staff vs client separation
- Required: `src/routes/guards.tsx` or equivalent

#### 1.2 Audit Sharing & Access
- Identify UI points for: invite guest, generate share link, accept link, revoke access
- Document domain restriction logic
- Map permission levels to UI controls
- Required endpoints for B2B guest flow

#### 1.3 Audit Hub List Page
- Document data displayed (hub cards, status, dates)
- Identify all user actions (create hub, click hub, search, filter)
- Note which are functional vs placeholder
- Document required middleware endpoints

#### 1.4 Audit Staff View Sections (8 sections)
For each of: Overview, Client Portal, Proposal, Videos, Documents, Messages, Meetings, Questionnaire

- **Data displayed:** List every data point shown
- **User actions:** List every button/interaction
- **Current state:** Mark each as Working / Placeholder / Broken
- **Data source:** Where should this come from? (via middleware, not direct Graph)
- **Engagement tracking:** What events need to be captured?
- **API needs:** What endpoints does Stephen need?

#### 1.5 Audit Client View Sections (8 sections)
For each of: Overview, Proposal, Videos, Documents, Messages, Meetings, Questionnaire, People

- Same audit criteria as staff sections
- Note differences from staff view (read-only vs editable)
- **People section:** Explicitly document invite/revoke/share/domain restriction flows

#### 1.6 Audit Shared Components
- Review HubLayout, ClientHubLayout, HubSidebar
- Document navigation flow
- Identify any broken links or missing routes

---

## Phase 2: Data Architecture

**Goal:** Create the TypeScript types and service layer that enables clean separation between UI and data source.

### Deliverables
- `src/types/` — TypeScript interfaces for all data
- `src/services/` — API service abstraction
- `src/hooks/` — React Query hooks for data fetching
- `src/routes/` — Route guards and protected routes

---

## Phase 3: Section-by-Section Implementation

**Goal:** Update each component to use the new data architecture and ensure all interactions work.

### Implementation Order
1. Auth + Guards
2. Login
3. Hub List
4. Overview (Staff)
5. Proposal (Staff)
6. Documents (Staff)
7. Messages (Staff)
8. Meetings (Staff)
9. Videos (Staff)
10. Questionnaire (Staff)
11. Client Portal (Staff)
12-19. Client View sections

---

## Phase 4: Integration Documentation

**Goal:** Create a complete API specification that Stephen can use to build the middleware.

### Deliverable
`docs/API_SPECIFICATION.md` — The contract between front-end and middleware

### Key Requirements
- All endpoints versioned with `/api/v1/` prefix
- All data endpoints hub-scoped (`/api/v1/hubs/{hubId}/...`)
- Client portal endpoints under `/api/v1/hubs/{hubId}/portal/...`
- Event types defined as enum (not free-text strings)
- Pagination/sort/filter params documented for all list endpoints
- Common error shape documented
- Licensing caveats noted (Teams Premium for recordings/transcripts)
- Microsoft Forms API limitations acknowledged

---

## Phase 5: Testing Strategy

**Goal:** Ensure every section works correctly through automated Playwright tests, CI pipeline, and manual UAT.

---

## Implementation Workflow

### Review Checkpoints

| Checkpoint | What Gets Reviewed | Scope |
|------------|-------------------|-------|
| **1. Phase 1 Complete** | `docs/FRONTEND_AUDIT.md` | Audit document — validates understanding |
| **2a. Phase 2: Types** | `src/types/*.ts` | Data model — catches schema issues early |
| **2b. Phase 2: Services/Hooks** | `src/services/*.ts`, `src/hooks/*.ts`, `src/routes/*.ts` | Architecture patterns |
| **3. Phase 3: Sections** | Components in batches of 3-4 | Incremental review |
| **4. Phase 4 Complete** | `docs/API_SPECIFICATION.md` | API contract for Stephen |
| **5. Phase 5 Complete** | `tests/*.ts`, `.github/workflows/ci.yml` | Test coverage |

### Working Order

1. Complete work for checkpoint
2. Commit changes
3. Run build/tests to verify
4. Provide summary to Hamish
5. Wait for senior dev feedback
6. Incorporate feedback if needed
7. Proceed to next checkpoint

## Senior Dev Sign-Off ✅

**Date:** 2025-11-29

All phases approved:
- **Phase 3:** All sections refactored, hub-scoped, and instrumented; security and navigation issues resolved
- **Phase 4:** API spec matches the front-end and the Microsoft 365 OBO model; endpoints and types are consistent
- **Phase 5:** Test infrastructure + suites cover critical paths; login selectors and credentials fixed; client invites use domain-restricted email flow; console/a11y gates included; CI wired

### Next Steps
1. Configure MSAL and API base URL in env for a real tenant
2. Hand the API spec to Stephen to implement middleware in the priority order listed
3. Optional: Add a short "Operations Runbook" doc for deploying env vars and rotating credentials
