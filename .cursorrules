# AgentFlow Pitch Hub v0.1

## Coding Standards

Follow GOLDEN_RULES.md for all development. Key principles:
- Question → Plan → Approval → Code workflow
- SRP, DRY, SoC, Security by Default
- No file over 300 lines, no function over 40 lines
- Validate all inputs, never hardcode secrets

**Pragmatic application:** This is a wireframe prototype with no backend yet. Apply GOLDEN_RULES.md sensibly — focus on clean components, consistent patterns, and brand guidelines. Full testing, comprehensive error handling, DTOs, and security hardening come later when middleware is connected. Don't over-engineer placeholder screens.

## What This Project Is

This is a wireframe prototype for AgentFlow's Pitch Hub — a client portal for managing new business pitches. AgentFlow is using this to pitch its own services before selling the full platform to professional services firms.

**Current status:** Front-end wireframes only. No middleware, no API connections, no real authentication. All buttons, forms, and interactions are visual placeholders.

## Key Documentation

- **GOLDEN_RULES.md** — Coding standards for all development
- **VISION_AND_ASSUMPTIONS.md** — Read this to understand the product. Explains the full vision, what's in scope for v0.1, and all middleware technical assumptions.
- **docs/PRD_FULL_PRODUCT.md** — The complete product requirements document for the full AgentFlow Hubs platform. Reference for future features, not current scope.
- **README.md** — Project setup and brand guidelines.

## What We're Building (v0.1 Scope)

Two user experiences:

**AgentFlow Staff View:**
- Login (Microsoft SSO placeholder)
- Hub List (dashboard of all pitch hubs)
- Hub Overview (workspace for managing a pitch)
- Client Portal (curate what clients see)
- Videos (upload, record, manage)
- Documents (client docs and internal docs)
- Messages (email integration placeholder)
- Meetings (scheduling, recordings, transcripts)
- Questionnaire (Microsoft Forms integration)

**Client View:**
- Overview (welcome page, hero content, quick links)
- Proposal (document viewer with commenting)
- Videos (watch shared videos)
- Documents (view, download, upload back)
- Messages (conversation history)
- Meetings (view, join, request)
- Questionnaire (complete forms)
- People (access management)

## What We're NOT Building Yet

- Client Hubs (ongoing client delivery) — v0.1 is pitch/new business only
- Expansion Radar (AI upsell detection)
- Relationship Health scoring
- Client Assistant AI (natural language Q&A)
- Leadership portfolio roll-up views
- Real Microsoft Graph API integration (Stephen is building middleware separately)
- Multi-tenant deployment

## Code Patterns

### Component Structure

```tsx
// Use shadcn/ui components where possible
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button"
import { Card, CardHeader, CardTitle, CardContent } from "@/components/ui/card"

// Tailwind for custom styling, using brand colours
<div className="bg-[#fdfaf6] text-[#3c3c3c]">
  <h1 className="text-[#3d5fa8] font-bold">Heading</h1>
</div>
```

### Placeholder Data

All data is placeholder. Use realistic-looking fake data that demonstrates the UI:

```tsx
// Good: Realistic placeholder
const pitchHubs = [
  { id: 1, name: "Whitmore & Associates", status: "Active", lastActivity: "2 hours ago" },
  { id: 2, name: "Hartley Grant Partners", status: "Draft", lastActivity: "Yesterday" },
];

// Bad: Obviously fake
const pitchHubs = [
  { id: 1, name: "Test Client", status: "test", lastActivity: "test" },
];
```

### No Real API Calls

This is wireframes only. Don't add:
- Fetch calls to real endpoints
- Authentication logic
- Microsoft Graph API code
- Database connections

If you need to simulate async behaviour, use setTimeout with placeholder data.

## When In Doubt

1. Read VISION_AND_ASSUMPTIONS.md — Section 2 defines v0.1 scope
2. Check GOLDEN_RULES.md — but apply pragmatically for wireframes
3. Keep it visual — we're building wireframes, not functionality
4. Use the brand colours — consistency matters
5. Make it look real — placeholder data should be believable
6. Don't over-engineer — simple React components, no complex state management yet
